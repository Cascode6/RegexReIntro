# RegexReIntro
A presentation, some code, and some links about getting started with the python Re module

darmok.txt is the original transcript of the star trek episode, Darmok [source](http://www.chakoteya.net/NextGen/202.htm).

darmik.txt is a somewhat blasphemous practice file, with errors introduced so that anyone can practice on it.

regexParse.py was authored by me, except for the example phone pattern taken from [http://www.diveintopython.net/regular_expressions/phone_numbers.html](http://www.diveintopython.net/regular_expressions/phone_numbers.html) as an excellent example of an exhaustively efficient use of re. 

Created for the Orlando Python Meetup, presentation originally given 7/26/2016. Enjoy!
